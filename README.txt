Start and stop charging your car on a schedule, or based on other conditions you model in a flow. Take action when your car starts charging, or send a notification if no car is connected to remind you to connect your car. Disable your charger if you leave your home for a longer period. Access statistics for the last charge session, last month or for the lifetime of the charger.
